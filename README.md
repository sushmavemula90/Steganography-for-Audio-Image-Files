# Steganography-for-Audio-Image-Files
Developed a steganography-based encryption tool that allows users to securely hide and retrieve secret messages within audio (.wav) and image (.jpg/.png) files. This project integrates Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter to provide a user-friendly GUI for encrypting and decrypting hidden data.
